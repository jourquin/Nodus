/**
 * This is a very simple plugin for Nodus, showing how the basics can be implemented. A plugin class
 * must extend NodusPlugin.<br>
 * - This plugin is added to the "Tools" menu, and appears as "Sample plugin". <br>
 * - It gets the NodusMapPanel, which is the main entry point of the Nodus API. <br>
 * - It opens a Nodus console and writes the name if the loaded project, if any. <br>
 * <br>
 * Once the jar generated from this file, it can be placed in two locations: <br>
 * - In the "plugins" subdirectory of the Nodus installation directory. In this case, the plugin is
 * loaded at Nodus launch time, and is available as long as Nodus is running. This is used for
 * general plugins.<br>
 * - In a project directory. In this case, the plugin is loaded when a project located in this
 * directory is loaded. The plugin will also be unloaded when the project is closed. This is used
 * for project specific plugins.
 * 
 * A plugin must extend edu.uclouvain.core.nodus.NodusPlugin. See the API doc for this class
 * for more information.
