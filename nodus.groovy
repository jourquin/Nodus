/**
 * Sample "autoexec" Groovy script. The "nodus.groovy" script, if exists, is run by Nodus at
 * launch time and also just before exit.
 * 
 * Three variables are set by Nodus when this script is called:
 * - startNodus = true and quitNodus = false at startup
 * - startNodus = false and quiteNodus = true at closing
 * - nodusMapPanel, the NodusMapPanel instance of the running Nodus. This is used as entry point 
 *   to the API.
 * 
 * This example shows how to interact with the Nodus API (zoom on the European zone of the 
 * World map). 
 * 
 * The same "autoexec" mechanism exists at the projet level: if a [projetname].groovy script is
 * found in the directory that contains the [projetname].nodus file, it is executed when the 
 * project is loaded and closed. The "openProject", "closeProject" and "nodusMapPanel" variables
 * are then set by Nodus.
 * 
 * Example Groovy, Python and R scripts can be found in the script directory.
