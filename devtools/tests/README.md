# Regression checks

## Assignment timing checks

Run `sh devtools/tests/run-computing-times-test.sh` from the project root with a JDK 11 or later.
The standalone checks use a controlled clock and two threads to verify overlapping worker times,
database-time attribution, repeated cost passes, resetting between assignments, disabled auditing
and partial-run reporting. Compilation uses a temporary directory and requires no external libraries.

## Cost parser cache checks

`CostParserCacheTest.java` checks formula reuse, changing variable values, movement/node
transitions, formula overrides, custom functions and parser errors. Its inputs are in-memory test
layers and formulas; it does not open or modify a project or database. Run it after changing the
cost parser or its expression cache. Run the following commands from the project root:

```sh
ant build-project
nodus_test_dir=$(mktemp -d)
javac --release 11 -cp 'classes:lib/*:lib/groovy/*:jdbcDrivers/*' -d "$nodus_test_dir" devtools/tests/CostParserCacheTest.java
java -Djava.awt.headless=true -cp "$nodus_test_dir:classes:lib/*:lib/groovy/*:jdbcDrivers/*" edu.uclouvain.core.nodus.compute.costs.CostParserCacheTest
rm -r "$nodus_test_dir"
```

## Service index checks

`ServiceIndexTest.java` checks indexed ID and stop lookups against linear searches, including
missing services, frequency/means edits, renaming, replacement, removal and reload. It also checks
edits through the live stop list (including iterator and sublist edits), cloning, serialization and
concurrent assignment readers. Inputs are synthetic services held in memory; no project, database
or GUI is opened. Run it after changing service storage or stop indexing, from the project root:

```sh
ant build-project
nodus_test_dir=$(mktemp -d)
javac --release 11 -cp 'classes:lib/*:lib/groovy/*:jdbcDrivers/*' -d "$nodus_test_dir" devtools/tests/ServiceIndexTest.java
java -Djava.awt.headless=true -cp "$nodus_test_dir:classes:lib/*:lib/groovy/*:jdbcDrivers/*" edu.uclouvain.core.nodus.services.ServiceIndexTest
rm -r "$nodus_test_dir"
```

These are developer regression checks, not runtime measurements. To measure an actual assignment,
use `NodusC.displayComputingTimes` and run the assignment normally in Nodus.

## Multi-flow edge update checks

`MultiFlowEdgeUpdatesTest.java` compares the affected-edge updates with the original full-graph
passes, using the real Dijkstra and A* implementations on synthetic networks. It checks alternative
routes, edge weights, path marks and assigned volumes for both Fast and Exact multi-flow schedules.
Cases include shared edges, multiple origins and commodity groups, unavailable loading modes,
unreachable destinations, discarded paths, successive OD rows, zero/infinite weights and cost
overflow. It also verifies that unused links are skipped during volume distribution.

Run it after changing multi-flow edge updates, from the project root. No project files, database
or GUI are used:

```sh
ant build-project
nodus_test_dir=$(mktemp -d)
javac --release 11 -cp 'classes:lib/*:lib/groovy/*:jdbcDrivers/*' -d "$nodus_test_dir" devtools/tests/MultiFlowEdgeUpdatesTest.java
java -Djava.awt.headless=true -cp "$nodus_test_dir:classes:lib/*:lib/groovy/*:jdbcDrivers/*" edu.uclouvain.core.nodus.compute.assign.workers.MultiFlowEdgeUpdatesTest
rm -r "$nodus_test_dir"
```

For performance measurements, run a Fast or Exact multi-flow assignment in Nodus with
`NodusC.displayComputingTimes` enabled and compare the path-computation and total times.
