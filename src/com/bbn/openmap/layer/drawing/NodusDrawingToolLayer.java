/**
 * This is a "dummy" class used by Nodus. The only reason it exists is that the drawing layer
 * associated to the nodes and links has no utility for the user. So, it is best to hide it.
 *
 * <p>In order to do that, a call to setVisible(false) is not enough, because the layer still
 * appears as grayed in the layer panel. So a subclass of the LayersPanel is created, which
 * tests the presence of a NodusDrawingToolLayer. The instances of this class are not displayed in
 * the panel.
