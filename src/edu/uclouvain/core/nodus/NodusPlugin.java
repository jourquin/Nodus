/**
 * Skeleton that must be used for all plugins written for Nodus. The development of a plugin for
 * Nodus is very simple:
 *
 * <p>- Create a new class that extends NodusPlugin. - In this class, getProperties must return a
 * set of properties which control where and how the menu item relative to the plugin must be added.
 * - Start real work of the plugin in the "execute" member function To use the plugin, just put a
 * copy (or a link) to the plugin jar into the "plugins" directory of your Nodus installation. When
 * launched, Nodus will detect all the jar's in this directory which contain a valid
 * NodusPlugin and will create a relevant "plugins" menu.
 *
 * <p>If a plugin is developed for a given project, it can be put in a "projectname_plugins" dir of
 * the project directory. Such project dependent plugins will only appear when the project is
 * loaded.
