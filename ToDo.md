## Transit times
- Allow "time" functions with the same pattern as cost functions
- Put "time" operations on path header.
- Backward compatibility : use the old "loading times" if present and no new time function is defined

## Exclusions
- Allow "all but" or "nothing but"
- Ask for reverse operation
- Include scenario
- Backward compatibility : script to upgrade exclusion table or automatic upgrade
- Display "-1" as default value in dialog
