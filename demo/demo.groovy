/**
 * Sample project specific "autoexec" Groovy script. Such a script must have the same name as the 
 * project itself. If exists, is run by Nodus when the project is open and closed.
 * 
 * Three variables are set by Nodus when a script is called:
 * - openProject = true and closeProject = false at opening
 * - openProject = false and closeProject = true at closing
 * - nodusMapPanel, the NodusMapPanel instance of the running Nodus. This is used as entry point 
 *   to the API.
 * 
 * This example shows how to launch a Py4J and a J4R bridge server, allowing to connect to Nodus from
 * your favorite Python or R environment, providing that the Python Py4J and the J4R packages are
 * installed (the corresponding jar files are provided with Nodus). Launching these servers is not
 * hardcoded in Nodus, allowing for more flexibility in the way they are used (remote access,
 * used ports...). Please refer to the documentation of both packages for more information.
 * 
 * Launching these servers is not mandatory if you don't plan to use Python or R scripts. 
 * If you use only one of these languages, you obvioulsy can decide to launch only the relevant
 * server. 
 *  
 * This script also shows how to store objects for later use in another script (or a subsequent
 * run of the same script. The storeObject(...) and retrieveObject() methods of the Nodud API are
 * here used to store the instances of the Py4J and J4R servers at launch time. Theys are later
 * retrieved for shutdown when the project is closed.
 *
 * 
 * Example Groovy, Python and R scripts can be found in the scripts directory.
