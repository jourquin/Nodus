# Trademark Policy for NODUS (UCLouvain)

**Effective Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Last Updated:** June 17, 2025

## 1. Introduction

The name **“NODUS”**, the NODUS logo, and other associated marks, tradenames or signs (collectively, the “Marks”) are trademarks, names and signs owned by Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain). We have created this trademark policy to clarify how the Marks may be used in connection with the NODUS open-source project, including software distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.

While the software itself is open-source, the Marks are not. We aim to promote community contributions and derivative works while maintaining trust in and recognition of the official NODUS project.

## 2. Acceptable Use

You **may** use the NODUS Marks:

- To refer to the **official NODUS project** hosted at [https://nodus.uclouvain.be](https://nodus.uclouvain.be)
- In **descriptive references** (e.g., “based on NODUS” or “compatible with NODUS”), provided:
  - Your use does not suggest endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship by NODUS or UCLouvain.
  - The context makes it clear that your version is a fork, derivative, or third-party integration.

Examples of acceptable use:
- “This plugin integrates with the NODUS platform.”
- “A modified version of NODUS for academic experiments.”

## 3. Restricted Use

You **may not**:

- Use the Marks on **modified versions** of the software **without clearly distinguishing** your version from the official one.
- Use the Marks in a way that implies **endorsement** or **official status** if your project is not affiliated with NODUS or UCLouvain.
- Register domain names, social media handles, or company names that include “NODUS” or similar confusingly related terms.
- Use the Marks on promotional materials for **commercial offerings** without prior written permission.

Examples of prohibited use:
- “NODUS Cloud Suite” for a paid service unless licensed.
- “nodusplus.com” hosting a forked version.

## 4. Modified Versions and Forks

If you fork or modify NODUS software:

- You must rename your distribution if the changes are significant.
- You must not use the NODUS logo or suggest that your version is the official one.
- You are encouraged to state: “This project is derived from the official NODUS project by UCLouvain, available at https://nodus.uclouvain.be.”

## 5. Commercial Use

If you wish to use the Marks in **commercial contexts** (e.g., consulting services, branded integrations, training, or product packaging):

- Please contact us at [louvaintransfer@uclouvain.be](mailto:louvaintransfer@uclouvain.be) to request a license or permission.
- Commercial use may be permitted with appropriate agreements in place.

## 6. Enforcement

We reserve the right to protect the integrity of the NODUS name and logo. If we become aware of improper or confusing use, we may request modification or discontinuation of that use. Non-compliance may result in legal action under applicable trademark laws.

## 7. Questions or Requests
