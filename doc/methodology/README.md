# Methodological note

Nodus 8.x is not provided with a complete reference or user guide. It is
however important that the user has a good understanding of the methodological
framework the software is based on. This is particularly true for the "Virtual
Networks" and the different cost functions they need.

This document is largely inspired by the reference guide that was written for Nodus 4.0
(1999). Even if the later versions of the software are very different from
version 4.0, the methodological framework remains essentially unchanged.

The LaTeX files for this methodological note (in English and French) are provided
in the "latex" sub-directory.
