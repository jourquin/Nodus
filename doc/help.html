      <h1>Nodus documentation</h1>
      <p><br/>
         Nodus 8.x is not provided with complete reference and user
         guides. It is however important that the user has a good
         understanding of the methodological framework the software is
         based on. This is particularly true for the ``Virtual Networks''
         and the different cost functions they need. Therefore, several
         documents are provided in the "doc" directory, and a Nodus project
         can be found in the "demo" directory. The latest provides several
         examples on <a href="../demo/Demo.pdf">how to use the software</a>.
         <br/>

         To start with, a few <a href="images/screenshots.html">screenshots</a>
         can be visualized.<br/>

      Beside these documents, several papers presenting research
      projects in which Nodus was used were published or presented in
      conferences. Most papers can be downloaded on <a
